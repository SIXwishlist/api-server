About
=====

In a world dominated by cloud computing and the use of Docker containers, 
site hosting continues to be done mostly using tools like Cpanel or Plesk. 
Some of these tools were created in the 1990s (The Cpanel was created in 1996), 
and perhaps the time has come when they are no longer so relevant to the 
hosting business.

Website site designers and hosting companies need tools more appropriate to 
the technology we have available today.

DASPANEL is a proposal for a new model of development and hosting of websites.

This software is still in a pre alpha stage but, stay tuned for interesting 
news soon.
